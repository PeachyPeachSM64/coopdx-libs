# Character Select with ModFS

Allows you to load your own characters in Character Select and send them to other people with ModFS.

## Installation

- Download this mod and put the `cs-modfs` directory in your mods directory.
- Put the files `lugia.modfs` and `hooh.modfs` in your `%AppData%/sm64coopdx/sav` directory.

## Commands

- `/loadchar <modPath>`: Loads the character of the ModFS `modPath` and sends it to other people.

## Troubleshooting

- Due to a bug in Character Select, characters loaded after mod initialization don't appear immediately. To fix it, open the Character Select menu and press the <kbd>R</kbd> button twice.

## Template
